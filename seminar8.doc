1. 
Price appreciation (capital gains).
    As interest rates change the value of a bond changes.
    If interest rates decrease after a bond is purchased
    the value of that bond will increase as relative to the
    market rate the bond offers a better return than it did
    originally.
    If interest rates increase after the bond if purchased the
    opposite occurs.
    As such investors can potentially make extra returns by 
    selling their bonds early if interest rates move favourably.

Coupon payments (interest payments).
    Bonds typically offer coupon payments of some fixed amount
    every X periods (this could be monthly, yearly, etc).
    These consitute another source of return.

Reinvesting coupon payments (interest payments).
    An investor can choose to reinvest their coupon payments,
    by doing so the investor can earn even more money.
    Fun fact: many financial measures assume the coupon payments
    are reinvested because it is a very common and highly rational
    choice to make.

2. 
We have three main measures of yield each has their own set of 
advantages and disadvantages.
Yield to maturity (YTM).
    This is the compound rate of return over the life of a bond
    assuming that all coupons can be reinvested at that yield.
    You can think of this as saying, this is the return we would
    expect given we hold the bond to maturity and reinvest the coupon
    payments into something that offers the same level of return as the
    bond itself. 
    This has some issues:
        1. We have to hold the bond to maturity in order to get the YTM.
            What if I don't want to hold the bond to maturity? 
            What if I would make more money if I sold it early?
        2. We assume that the bond issuer pays all payments in full exactly
            on time. If this was a completely valid assumption to make 100%
            of the time then investing in bonds would have no credit risk
            which is obviously untrue! There is always a risk that the person
            or firm borrowing money from you doesn't pay you back.
        3. We have to immediately reinvest at the correct level of return in 
            order to earn the YTM. What if there are no opportunities to reinvest
            at the same rate as the bond? Maybe the market is going down and I make
            less money. Or heavens forbid... What if I accidentally make too much money?

Holding period return (HPR).
    This is effectively the same as the HPR of a stock. (Capital gain + cash flows received)/price paid
    Shockingly this also has some issues:
        1. This is a forecasted measure of return, I sit at time 0 and my plan is
            to sell at time 10. I don't know how much the bond will be worth at time
            10 so I estimate my return based on my assumptions of what will happen 
            with interest rates as well as the credit worthiness of the counterparty
            of the bond. 

Current yield.
    This is just the coupon/market price of the bond.
    The main issue with the current yield is:
        1. It really only gives a very specific snapshot about the bond and doesn't consider
            anything about future expectations. For example the current yield of a bond
            might be 1000000000%. Sounds like a great investment right, but the company that
            issued the bond is going bankrupt in 3 days and only has assets of Â£1.50. 
            As such there's very little chance that you will actually be earning that return
            in the future.

3. 
a. 
We have a bond selling at par. This means that the face value is equal to the current market
price of the bond. As such the face value is $100.
With a coupon rate of 6% this mens our coupon payments will be $6 per year and the maturity of the
bond is 10 years. 
FV (face value) = 100
CF (cash flow) = 6
n = 10
r = 15%
Using the annuity formula we can get the value of this bond.
